Once upon a time
there was a parent who wanted to learn git better.
The challenge was complicated by a lack of a password management tool, because the parent is lazy and
because the daughter was insolent.
But only because she'd already set up the password management on her box as part of learning to use git.

Once the father properly configured the magic password tool, everything was fine until a spell of confusion was
cast across the repository.  No one could learn of the fathers heroic deeds because the git history was unknown.
Is there anyone in the land who can break the spell with 'diff'?

<<<<<<< HEAD
All hope is lost because the daughter reads manga instead of learning the spell to break the curse.
=======
The daughter decided to Google the answers, for surely another had run into the same stumbling block whilst using 'diff'.
